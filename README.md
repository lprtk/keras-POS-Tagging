## Content 

<p align="justify"> This project was realized in the context of an introductory course on Deep Learning applied to NLP. From sentences, composing a text, as well as the grammatical positions of each word, we had to use Part-Of-Speech Tagging (POS-Tagging) and Shallow-Parsing (chuncking) models in order to extract "hidden" information and the existing relations between words in a text. The objective is to use Deep Learning to quantify:<p> 
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">The difference between a POS-Tagging and Shallow-Parsing model; </p></li>
<li><p align="justify">The contribution, in the architecture, of a pre-trained embedding layer and of back-propagation to the vector representation of the embedding layer; </p></li>
<li><p align="justify">The impact on the predictive capacity of the models of more or less context around the word, whose grammatical tag is to be predicted, by varying the ngram range; </p></li>
<li><p align="justify">The difference between an architecture implementing a per-task model versus a multi-task architecture; </p></li>
<li><p align="justify">The difference between a simple multi-task model and a hierarchical multi-task model consisting in building a cascade architecture where the tasks do not intervene at the same depth of the neural network.</p></li>
</ul>
